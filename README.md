# b3orgtheme

Vanilla Bootstrap v3 theme : static components
Pulls in "default" theme from Bootswatch.

## Installation

Although it can be installed as a django app, its intended use is to be
deployed to an artefacts server so that static assets can be pointed to by
the relevant `fwtheme-django` or `fwtheme-django-<orgname>`.
